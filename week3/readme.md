TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 3
variable.isdigit():  --> checks if the variable is a number
Exercise1 was relatively easy to understand, still difficult to do but the logic made sense. 
There were a few issues with isdigit and string and numbers with outputs.
One exercise is not passing due to issue in test --> git pull to fix it
GIT PULL NOT WORKING (not a git repository (or any of the parent directories))
--> tried fixing git through force pulling still didnt work. Something went wrong and pulled the me repo in to the course file.
No tests are working now

Exercise3 making sense however it is consistently repeating. 

Started working but was easier to place not number rejector as a function and call it.
Needed to 'chastise' for choosing outside of bounds which wasn't thought of earlier. Hence I needed to create an extra code for outside of boundaries. 

Exercise4 started by looking online about binary searches. Not sure what to do ahead of this.
