TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 3
variable.isdigit():  --> checks if the variable is a number
Exercise1 was relatively easy to understand, still difficult to do but the logic made sense. 
There were a few issues with isdigit and string and numbers with outputs.
One exercise is not passing due to issue in test --> git pull to fix it
GIT PULL NOT WORKING (not a git repository (or any of the parent directories))

Exercise3 making sense however it is consistently repeating. 

Started working but was easier to place not number rejector as a function and call it
