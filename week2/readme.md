TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
apple = 11
banana = 5
The equal signs here are the assignment operators
However, apple == banana, the double equal is not the same as the previous equal.
== essentially checks whether the two variables are equal
VALUES;
0,1,2,3 etc --> integers (counting numbers)
'Aiden' , "dude" , 'c' --> strings (means text or things treated as text)
0.5 , 0.1 , 1.57 --> floats (means decimal)
True or False --> boolean 

def = define --> define functions with a name, use same idea for variables and naming

COLLECTIONS;
Square brackets define lists
Round brackets define tupels (essentially same as lists)
Curly braces define dictionaries (key: value) pairs

All these can be placed within each other

""" doc string """ (triple quotes)

Exercise 0

name.upper() --> creates an upper case of the string

convert integer to string by str(number)

to add text simply place + 'text'
