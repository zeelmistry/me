TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Installed both GIT and VS CODE. Using python on Mac has its differences
dir = ls (for Mac) - ls is to check where you are in the folders
cd = change directory - moves you to a different folder eg; cd me or cd 1161 
cd .. will move you a folder up
The course has 3 seperate REPOS
All admin work completed.

STARTING WORK
For mac, instead of python ../etc do python3 ../etc
