TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week there was no class due to DIG Day. 

Continued to look through data for the assignment. Using the jupyter notebook i was finally able to properly view my data. 
I had to remove the label tags in the excel file to open it in jupyter.
I have to go through 49 columns of information. Seems relatively easy to do but is going to take a long to complete. 
The data opening and using the commands provided in the file makes it much easier to work through.
Still unsure how to look at some plots due to there being a lot of mix up in the labels since there is immense amounts of data.
