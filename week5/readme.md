TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

WEEK 5
LECTURE:
Refactor - once you've done your code go back in and tidy it up --> you can change the code to make it easier to work with 
    shallow indentation is good compared to heaps of indentation --> try to refactor through calling functions and other things

Recursion - a function that calls itself with new inputs

Exercise 1:

Moved getting ready to start repetition from the defined do munch of bad things to the actual function. This allows us to call it instead making it more comprehendable.
