TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
For this week we got our assignment marked. 
The confusing part was the committing and pushing. We were able to push and pull to get the same code. Then after that we both took screenshots and pushed. 
Coauthor pushing seemed complicated however researching it made it much easier.
--> to co-author, you needed to place the coauthor in the commit message with the coauthors name the git hub email. 

The rest of the lesson was opening our data in jupyter. This was used to sift through the data and create different ways of viewing it.
