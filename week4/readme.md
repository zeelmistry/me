TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
WEEK 4
#dictionary
my_dict = {"key":"value"}

my_dict["key"] --> returns "value"

you can have dictionary inside a dictionary

eg:
my_dict = {"degrees":{"something":"0", "wow":"2"}, "key":"value"}
my_dict["degrees"] = {"something":"0", "wow":"2"}
to return 2 do this --->  my_dict["degrees"]["wow"] = 2

If theres a list in the dictionary use [1] the number doesnt matter choose from 0-(number of items in list-1) depending on which item you want from the list

Continued to complete the work the week after.

Reading and calling the lazyduck json data was relatively easy and intuitive. 
The wordy pyramid caused a few issues due to the api key. I was able to sign up, however I need to wait one week before recieving it. 
Pokedex exercise was slightly challenging but did make sense. Was able to call data and compare it against each other.
The diarist exercise was completed with the help of a tutor. The code makes sense and is relatively simple.
-> ultimatley it opens the file and defines a certain amount as 0. This then counts the specific line and everytime it does it adds to the amount. This then creates a file with the string amount. 

Wordnik Api came in however there is another issue around the amount of students that can use the code.
