TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
LECTURE:
#dictionary
my_dict = {"key":"value"}

my_dict["key"] --> returns "value"

you can have dictionary inside a dictionary

eg:
my_dict = {"degrees":{"something":"0", "wow":"2"}, "key":"value"}
my_dict["degrees"] = {"something":"0", "wow":"2"}
to return 2 do this --->  my_dict["degrees"]["wow"] = 2

If theres a list in the dictionary use [1] the number doesnt matter choose from 0-(number of items in list-1) depending on which item you want from the list
